## Project Description
This project is a **warehouse management system** built in Python, designed to simulate real-world warehouse operations.  
It includes support for multiple product categories, product reservations, purchase logic, warranty/expiration checks, and manager-only operations during restricted hours.  

The system also comes with a simple **graphical interface** (using PyQt6) that mirrors the command-line menu.

## Features
- **Product categories:**
  - Food Products (with expiration dates)
  - Electronic Products (with warranty dates)
  - Clothing Products (with size, color, material)

- **Core functionalities:**
  - Add new products
  - Update product details
  - Buy products
  - Reserve products for later pickup
  - Apply discounts
  - Delete products
  - Automatically remove expired or out-of-warranty items

- **Reservation system:**
  - Products can be reserved for a future date & time
  - Expired reservations are automatically cleared
  - Reserved products show separately from warehouse stock

- **Business rules enforced:**
  - Expired food items cannot be purchased or reserved
  - Electronics out of warranty cannot be purchased or reserved
  - Manager-only operations (e.g., adding/removing products, discounts) are allowed only between **23:00–06:00**

- **Graphical UI (PyQt6):**
  - Main window with:
    - Menu (select operations by number + submit button)
    - Category buttons (Food / Electronics / Clothing)
    - Product list displayed per category (warehouse + reservations)
  - Each operation opens a new window for user input
  - Success and error messages shown in dialogs

## Usage
Run the program:
```bash
python main.py
```
- The main window will show the warehouse menu and product categories.
- Choose an option by entering its number and pressing Submit.
- Or click a category button (Food / Electronics / Clothing) to view available products.
- When performing actions (buying, reserving, adding, etc.), a new input window will open.
- Messages will guide you if the action succeeds or fails.

- Start program → main window opens with menu.
- Click Food Products → see all food items (with expiration dates).
- Choose menu option 3 (Buy Product) → input name + quantity → success message shows.
- Try to reserve an expired product → system blocks with warning.
- Manager logs in at 23:30 → can add new stock and apply discounts.

- Customers can buy or reserve anytime, but outside business hours the action is logged for the next business day.
